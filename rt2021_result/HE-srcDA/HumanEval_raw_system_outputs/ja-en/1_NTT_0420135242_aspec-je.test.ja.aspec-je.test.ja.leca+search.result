The author\'s new theory on the glass transition point from crosslinked resin to linear polymer is described.
The author has already published the paper in the title of \"new theory on physical properties from crosslinked resin to linear polymer: Melting point, glass transition point (Tg) and strength\" in J. Applied Polymer Science (Vol.97, 1467-1475 (2005)).
In the new theory, the g also changes, because the crosslinked resin forms the segment which differs by the temperature of curing and post-curing.
And, TG of linear polymer was made to be a temperature of 1% in thermal elongation rate of the C-C bond from 0 °C, by regarding the bond part of 2 rows combined by the van der Waals force between main chains as a segement.
\"Elongation\", \"differences of Tg and segment between crosslinked resin and linear polymer\", \"relation between melting and molecular size\", \"relation between post-Tg and new segment\", and \"handling of linear expansion coefficient\" are described in order to explain these new theory.

This paper outlines the complicated interaction between the immune system of pigs and PCV2.
This paper introduces the evidence that PCV2 is a main pathogen of pigs under appropriate environment and management conditions.
Extensive stimulation of the immune system is one of the essential conditions to inducepig multiorgan-underdeveloped after weaning syndrome(PMWS) in PCV2-infected pigs.
And, PCV2 itself is a pathogen in which the existence is indispensable in lethal PMWS.
Effective immunological response to pathogens other than PCV2 is insufficient in PMWS-contracted pigs.
On the immunosuppressive condition in PMWS, PCV2 may be an important factor of the secondary immunodeficiency under some fixed environments, based on the clinic, pathological and immunological observation observed in the field.

The basic disease state of bronchial asthma is chronic airway inflammation.
In the airway inflammation, many cells such as eosinophils, T-cells, mast cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and airway epithelium, and various liquid factors are involved.
It is taken seriously that the Th2 cytokine is concerned even in not only central airway but also peripheral airway on the position of the airway inflammation.
In addition, the disease states of airway remodeling such as peeling and turning into embryonic cell, basal membrane thickening, hypertrophy and hyperplasia of airway smooth muscle, and angiogenesis of tracheal epithelial cell are clarified, and the irreversible airway closure is brought about, and the airway anaphylaxia is chronically tracheal smooth muscle, and it becomes a cause of seriousness and inveterateness of the asthma.
For the treatment of asthma, it is important to introduce antiinflammatory drugs such as inhalation steroids from the early stage in order to suppress the remodeling of the airway in addition to the control of allergic inflammation.
Bronchial asthma is characterized by repeated paroxysmal stridor, dyspnea and cough, which are easy to appear at night and early morning, and auscultation finding is continuous whistle-like sound, especially harmonic flute-like sound.
In addition, the objective evaluation of the air flow restriction by the respiratory function test is necessary for the diagnosis of the asthma.
It is evaluated by spirometry and peak flow meter, and the airway hypersensitivity test is carried out.
The evaluation of the airway inflammation is carried out by sputum test, nitrogen monoxide concentration in the expiration, expiration condensate measurement, and allergological examination.
The diseases which cause stridor and dyspnea such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, insufficiency of left heart, hyperventilation syndrome, etc. become an object of the differentiation.
It is important in the clinical diagnosis that 1) the symptom which derives from the air flow restriction occurs paroxysmally and repeatedly, 2) there is the reversibility at least partially in the air flow restriction, 3) other diseases are excluded.
As a result of our genetic analysis, the possibility of fulfiling the important role in the disease state of the asthma was guessed the IL-17F gene.
PAI-1 It may be deeply involved in the formation of the remodeling of the airway, and the functional polymorphism of the PAI-1 gene seems to be one of the genetic factors which regulate whether the remodeling of the airway is easy to progress.
CCL5 is a chemokine strongly induced from the airway epithelium in the viral infection, and especially, it may fulfil the important role for the acquisition of the chronic airway inflammation in high-age asthma.
It was guessed that the natural immune system was deeply concerned in the disease state of the allergy, when the role of the macrophage inhibitory factor was noticed.
The understanding of the disease deepened by clarifying the pathophysiological and common pathway from them at the molecular level.
By making these routes to be a target, it is expected to contribute to the advance on prevention and treatment of asthma.
