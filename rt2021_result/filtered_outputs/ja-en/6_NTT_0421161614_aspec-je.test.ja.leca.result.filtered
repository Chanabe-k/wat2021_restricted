The basic disease state of bronchial asthma is chronic airway inflammation.
Many cells such as eosinophils, T-cells, mast cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and airway epithelium, and various liquid factors are involved in airway inflammation.
It is taken seriously that the Th2 cytokine is concerned even in not only central airway but also peripheral airway on the position of the airway inflammation.

For the treatment of the turf asthma, it is important to introduce the antiinflammatory drugs mainly on the inhalation steroids from the early stage in order to suppress the remodeling of the airway in addition to the control of the allergic inflammation.

In addition, objective evaluation of air flow restriction by the respiratory function test is necessary for the diagnosis of the asthma.
It is evaluated by spirometry and peak flow meter, and the airway hypersensitivity test is carried out.


It is important in the clinical diagnosis that 1) the symptom which derives from the air flow restriction occurs paroxysmally and repeatedly, 2) there is the reversibility at least partially in the air flow restriction, 3) other diseases are excluded.
As a result of our genetic analysis, the possibility that the IL-17F gene fulfils the important role in the disease state of asthma is guessed.
PAI-1 It may be deeply involved in the formation of the remodeling of the airway, and the functional polymorphism of the PAI-1 gene seems to be one of the genetic factors which regulate whether the remodeling of the airway is easy to progress.

This paper also describes the problems for effectively demonstrating the antimicrobial function.

In order to avoid the effects of elongation, polyester satin with minimum elongation in length and width direction was used.

In the future, it wants to expand the database construction by not only adding the case of other position but also examining skeletal structure for making it to be the clothes design of which movement is easy and that it is comfortable and the movable range.
This paper explains the circumstances in which Osaka GAS tackled the Internet.
The intranet which utilizes the Internet mechanism as it is is is optimum for the system mainly for information reading.
This paper explains merits and demerits of intranet.

The construction of total business support system using intranet is promoted.
In addition, this paper reports that various technological development programs are promoted to construct convenient applications.

On I, it was plate type, uniform thickness, and 4〜8μm by the low magnification (300 magnifications) observation.
However, the observation from the side view of the plate was not possible, and information such as the thickness was not obtained.
Light-field and dark-field images were observed at a medium magnification of several ten thousand times, and many fine particle adhesions on the sample surface and uniform thickness interference fringes corresponding to changes in the thickness were observed.
No lattice images were obtained by high resolutin power image observation.
On (II), the same observation as (I) was observed.
The reason why the full color electrophotographic image is inferior to the printed image in respect of the picture quality was examined.
The difference is considered to be caused by the micro‐structure in the thickness direction of the images.

As the result, it was proven that the printed image had small thickness of the image and high uniformity.
