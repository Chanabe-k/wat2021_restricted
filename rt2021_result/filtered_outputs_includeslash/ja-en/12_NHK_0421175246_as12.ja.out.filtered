No fire occurred.







It is planned to be carried out in Shizuoka district in 1999, and the situation is described.







After that, the sacrificial anode was successfully developed and the safety was improved.













Though there is a constraint in the application by the delay time of the processing system in the active noise control from the convention, the delay time can be shortened, if the prediction of the noise is possible by utilizing the property of the noise source, etc..
This paper takes up the press which repeatedly generates the noise of similar feature pattern, and carries out the sound attenuation simulation by 3 kinds of noise prediction systems.






It was clarified that even if the thermal conductivity is high, in the material with low melting point like aluminum alloy, the melting is generated in the juncture, and the high bonding strength is obtained by penetrating into the sintered body.


The effect of these methods on the forming of branch pipe was examined.








However, when the rotational speed is too large, the reverse deformation occurs.

And, the material was easy to extend in the circumferential direction, and the outer diameter increased.





And, though the monochrome has been the mainstream until now, the coloring advances very much in recent years.
In addition, since advance and extension to the POD (Print on Demand) field become one of the targets recently, further high picture quality and speedup which put the printing region in the visual field are required.
