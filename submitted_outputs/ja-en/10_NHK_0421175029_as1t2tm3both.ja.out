This paper describes a new theory on the glass transition temperature from crosslinked resin to linear polymer by the author.
The author has already announced the paper on the title of \"new theory on physical properties from crosslinked resin to linear polymer: melting point, glass transition point (Tg) and strength\" in J. Applied Polymer Science (Vol.97, 1467 - 1475 (2005)).
In the new theory, since the cross - linked resin forms different segments depending on the curing temperature and the post - curing temperature, the g of the cross - linked resin also changes.
And, Tg of the linear polymer was made to be the temperature in which the thermal elongation of the C-C bond from 0 ℃ was made to be 1%, considering the combination part of 2 rows combined by van der Waals force between main chains as a segment.
In order to explain these new theories, this paper describes \"elongation\", \"difference between Tg and segment of crosslinked resin and linear polymer\", \"relation between melting and molecular size\", \"relation between Tg and new segment\", and \"handling of linear expansion coefficient\".

Using head down tilt (HDT) which lowered the head by 6 degrees from the horizontal in the bed as a simulation of the microgravity, the sweat rate was measured continuously by fixing the probe in the left hand thumb palm side.
Though the sweat rate by handgrip (for 5 seconds in the largest grasping power) in HDT significantly lowered in the sitting position in comparison with the case without the back oppression, in the mental calculation load, the difference could not be recognized.
These results suggest that sweating during HDT is different between mental and exercise loads.
In the normal cell, the telomere is shortened, when it is divided, and the cell is aged, when some extreme value is exceeded.
In the meantime, in cancer cell and immortalization cell, the telomere is supplemented, since there is the telomerase activity, and the fixed length is kept without shortening further, and the infinite proliferation ability is acquired.
Therefore, the gene which controls the telomerase activity is regarded as one candidate of the cellular senescence induction gene.
The possibility of the existence of unknown telomerase control gene on chromosome 3 3p14 → p21 was indicated.

The basic disease state of bronchial asthma is chronic airway inflammation.
In the air duct inflammation, many cells such as eosinophil, T cell, mast cell, neutrophils, macrophage, airway epithelium and various liquid factors are concerned.
It is taken seriously that the Th2 cytokine is concerned even in not only central air duct but also peripheral air duct on the position of the air duct inflammation.
In addition, the disease state of air duct remodeling such as peeling and cell formation of the air duct epithelial cell, basement membrane hyperplasia, hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the air duct smooth muscle, angiogenesis is clarified, and the irreversible air duct blockage is brought about, and the air duct anaphylaxia is made to advance in the chronic, and it becomes a cause of seriousness and inveterateness of the breath.
It is important that the anti-inflammatory drug mainly on the inhalation steroid medicine is introduced from the early stage in order to suppress the remodeling of the air duct in addition to the control of allergic inflammation for the treatment of asthma.
In the auscultation opinion, it is the continuous sound, especially the sound that it is the high tone whistle, because it is generated by repeating stridor, dyspnea, cough of the fit, and that these are easy to appear in night and early morning.
In addition, objective evaluation of the air flow restriction by the respiratory function test is necessary for the diagnosis of breath.
It is evaluated by spirometry and peak flow meter, and the air duct anaphylaxia test is carried out.
The evaluation of the air duct inflammation is carried out by nitrogen monoxide concentration measurement in expiration, expiration condensate measurement, and in addition, allergology inspection.
The disease which causes stridor and dyspnea such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, left heart failure, hyperventilation syndrome becomes an object of the differentiation.
It is important in the clinical diagnosis that 1) the symptom which derives from the air flow restriction occurs in the paroxysmal repeatability, 2) there is at least partially the reversibility in the air flow restriction, 3) other disease is excluded.
As a result of our genetic analysis, the possibility of fulfiling the important role of IL-17F gene in the disease state of breath was guessed.
PAI-1 may be deeply concerned in the formation of the remodeling of the air duct, and the functional polymorphism of the PAI-1 gene seems to be one of the genetic factors which regulate whether the remodeling of the air duct is easy to progress.
