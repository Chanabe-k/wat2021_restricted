This paper proposes a phase ‐ stamp range finder (PSRF) using a three ‐ phase correlation image sensor (3PCIS).
Except for 3PCIS and three-phase reference signal generator, it is composed of parts equal to conventional light stripe and range finder.

Then, the three-dimensional shape of the object is obtained in real time by converting detected phase into the angle of the projection sheet beam.
Compared with a time stamp VLSI range finder, PSRF is less sensitive to spatial inhomogeneity of surface reflectance of an object and background illumination.
The structure of the proposed PSRF is simpler than that of the modulated PSRF.

In addition, the organization which examines and decides the unjust action like ORI (Office of Research Integrity) of U.S.A. should be urgently established.
A new theory of glass transition temperature (Tg) from crosslinked resins to linear polymers is presented.
The author already published the paper in the title of \"new theory on physical properties from crosslinked resin to linear polymer: Melting point, glass transition point (Tg) and strength\" in J.Applied Polymer Science (Vol.97, 1467-1475 (2005).
In the new theory, since the crosslinked resin forms different segments depending on the curing and postcuring temperatures, the g also changes.
The glass transition temperature (Tg) of linear polymers was set at 1% of the thermal elongation of the C-C bond from 0 °C by considering two rows of bonds bonded by van der Waals force between the main chains as segments.
In order to explain these new theories, this paper describes \"elongation\", \"difference in Tg and segment between crosslinked resin and linear polymer\", \"relation between melting and molecular size\", \"relation between Tg and new segment\", and \"handling of linear expansion coefficient\".
In the end of 2006, polonium attracted the attention of the world by the suspicious death accident of the former Russian Federal Safety Agency information department member.

Therefore, it is considered that past climate and environmental variation history can be clarified by analyzing and analyzing core samples collected by the ice cap.
Research and development of geothermal water in Japan began in 1955\'s.
The geothermal water market is a big market for the well industry or groundwater pumping industry in future Japan.
However, attention is necessary, because some hot spring wells contain combustible gas such as methane, which may cause accidents.
In addition, it is necessary to geologically analyze the strata and not to dig the wasted or harmful wells in the well.
In this paper, we describe the simulation of eye surgery using the finite element method (FEM).

And, the iron absorption from the duodenum is being adjusted by transporter (DMT-1 and ferroportin-1) of the duodenum.
The fact by the abnormality of these genes clarifies the iron excess disease.
Recently, it was proven that hepsidine and hemojuvenin controlled iron absorption from the duodenum.
Some azoospermic males have lost the region of the Y chromosome containing a heat shock transcription factor (HSFY) on the Y chromosome.
The expression of mouse HSFV-like sequence (mHSFYL), a mouse orthologue, was analyzed by in situ hybridization and found to be expressed mainly around spermatids in the testis.
The species with the gene similar to HSFY / mHSFYL was searched in the database, and it was recognized in Mammalia such as cattle, dog, chicken except for human and mouse.
The intracellular distribution was examined by the expression of mHSFYL labeled with HA or GFP in COS1 cells, and the localization in the cell nucleus was recognized.
These results suggest that HSFY / mHSFYL has an evolutionarily conserved function in spermatogenesis.
The effect of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) on the intestinum tenue was examined from the viewpoint of form and function.
The nucleus / cell ratio in epithelial cells of the small intestinal fimbria tended to increase by TCDD treatment.
As a result of examining the effect for glucose absorption ability, the glucose absorption ability in the intestinum tenue increased TCDD exposure C57BL / 6J mouse.
Possibility such as the increase in sugar transporter SGLUT1 and glucose transporter 2 mRNA, the increase in SGLUT1 protein, and the increase in lactase and maltase activity is indicated.
It was indicated that the glucose absorption ability promotion was the mechanism which compensated for internal sugar utilization efficiency lowering by the dioxin.
In the life activity, there is dynamic life activity which can not be estimated only from gene sequence and functional analysis of the protein.

Using the chromosome band number as information of the chromosome position, the chromosome that the number was assigned was collected, and whether there was the functional position was examined.
As the result, there was not always the coincidence between position and chromosome position of unidimensional genome.
It was proven that the index which can surely define the higher order position of the gene than the chromosome band had to be used as information of the chromosome position.
Trophic status of Quercus serrata saplings damaged by two insect pests, i.e., high and low elevations, was compared in relation to compensation.
In this experiment, the work which beforehand specified compensation value was carried out on all sapling leaves.
After that, branches were grown in a plot with different soil fertility.
Bud growth and branch elongation were controlled by original factors of Quercus serrata, and response to eating damage was controlled by individual levels.
The elongation of the damaged secondary and tertiary branches was significantly poorer when the soil fertility was poor.
When the fertility was high, it was as expected that it could be well compensated.

We examined the characteristics of center of gravity oscillation due to the functional depression of the central nervous system and the system to maintain the body balance in drinking, and clarified a part of the mechanism that causes the inability to stand upright due to the lowering of body function with aging.
Center of gravity oscillation characteristics in the sole plane were examined using the center of gravity oscillometer.
In the case of falling down by the effect of drinking, the oscillation of the displacement of front-back direction or right-left direction (or both directions) rapidly increased.
In this case, the transfer distance of center of gravity rapidly increased in the front-back direction (or both directions), and it came to the tipping over.
The p-p value of sway velocity amplitude of center of gravity in anteroposterior or lateral (or both directions) direction increased rapidly just before falling down.
And, the examinee whose the speed change in the normal was generally small was long for the time to the tipping over.

Measurement accuracy of the finger joint angle is 5 degrees.
Measurement range and measurement sensitivity are changed by changing the shape of the applied part of external force.
The characteristics of taurine uptake by human glioma cells were investigated using T98 cells.
Taurine uptake by T98 cells was Na + -dependent and had a high affinity system, and was decreased by the administration of phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (100 nM) or isoproterenol (1 μM).
Pretreatment with H-7 (100 nM) for 30 min increased the EC50 of the reducing effect of taurine from 41 to 83 nM.
These results suggest that protein kinase c and cAMP are involved in taurine intake.

It has been demonstrated so far that the ion range in the target can be controlled by the distance from the beam window to the target using the irradiation equipment for the cell connected to the beam line of the 3MV tandem accelerator.
We investigated the effects of controlled-permeability irradiation on tobacco pollen as a model cell system for local irradiation.
“Leaked pollen\", probably due to cell membrane damage, was frequently observed at the end of ion range.
When dried pollen (20 μm) irradiated with heavy ions was dyed with acetocarmine, leaky pollen was observed, but not with γ-ray irradiation.
The effects of He and C ions on the frequency of leaky pollen at several distances from the beam window are illustrated.
The frequency increased linearly with ion ‐ fluence for both ions, but C ‐ ions (LET 800keV / μm at the cell surface) were more effective than He ‐ ions (LET 180keV / μm).
The effect of the vascular flow in 3D TOF MRA was examined by the experiment using the phantom.
In the pulse flow, the signal intensity was lower than in the steady flow, especially in the vicinity of the inlet, due to the effect of the signal lowering by the phase dispersion.
The signal lowering by the pulsatile flow was obvious in narrow segment and curvature of the blood vessel.
Ghost artifacts due to pulsatile flow were observed, and the interval between ghost artifacts was proportional to the repetition time and the beat number.

Nonlinear phenomena represented by chaos of fractal have the possibility of quantification of numerical analysis.
Fractal analysis of event ‐ related potentials was performed and the results were used to investigate the fluctuating state of intellectual activity.
The peaks corresponding to N100 or P300 were not clearly observed.
This suggests that fractal analysis is more suitable for detecting the change in evoked dose than the peak.
It has become a problem that a balance of the autonomic nervous function is damaged by exposing to the microgravity.
Using head down tilt (HDT) which lowered the head by 6 degrees from the horizontal in the bed as a simulation of the microgravity, the sweat rate was continuously measured by the fixation of the probe in the left hand thumb palm side.
The sweat rate by the hand grip (for 5 seconds in largest grasping power) in HDT significantly lowered in sitting position in comparison with the case without the back oppression, but the difference could not be recognized in the mental calculation load.
These results suggest that sweating during HDT differs between mental and exercise loads.
In the normal cell, the telomere is shortened, when it divides, and the cell ages, when it exceeds some extreme value.
In the meantime, the telomere is complemented, since there is the telomerase activity in cancer cell and immortalization cell, and the limitless growth ability is acquired keeping the fixed length without shortening further.
Therefore, the gene which controls the telomerase activity is regarded as one candidate of the cellular aging induction gene.
These results suggest the existence of an unknown telomerase regulatory gene on chromosome 3p14 → p21.
An active electrode with a transmission function to derive surface myoelectric potential without skin pretreatment or conductive paste was fabricated.

Cold sense and pain of the right side lower leg were realized, and the ulcer with the sphacelus appeared in the right side anterior tibia division afterwards, and it was gradually exacerbated.
The pain was relieved, when 10μg / day of L was infused for 4 weeks with wound treatment such as cleaning of the ulcer division, etc., and the ulcer of the lower leg was reduced.
No side effects were observed during the treatment.
CGRP is secreted from the sensory nerve distribution region to the heart muscle.
Administration of CGRP for 48h increased the surface area of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes approximately twice.
Furthermore, CGRP upregulated mRNA expression for skeletal muscle α-actin and atrial natriuretic peptide.
These results suggest that CGRP is a potent hypertrophic factor for cardiomyocytes.
In order to obtain the data which would be able to adapt the artificial leg for walking mode except for the flatland, walking condition for flatland and slope way was measured.
Bending moment and subjective evaluation obtained by semiconductor strain gauge stuck to the lower leg pipe division were collected.
The bottom dorsiflexion angle was adjusted to and not adjusted to the angle of the slope on the slopes of 5 and 7 degrees.
In the case of the slopeway walking, the walking was the most easy, when plantar flexion and dorsiflexion were changed in proportion to the angle of the slopeway.

Simultaneously, emotional sweating volume and heart rate in giving the program as a mental stimulation were measured, and the correlation between both was examined.
A significant correlation was found between the normalized variance of emotional sweating and the variance of heart rate during the two programs.
And, there were the case in which there was the high correlation between normalized variance value of the mental sweating under program preparation and dispersion of the heart rate and case in which there is seldom the correlation.
Further experiments seemed to be necessary.
This paper outlines the complicated interaction between the immune system of pigs and PCV2.
This paper introduces the evidence that PCV2 is a main pathogen of pigs under appropriate environment and management conditions.
Extensive stimulation of the immune system is one of the essential conditions for inducing porcine postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) in PCV2-infected pigs.
And, PCV2 itself is the pathogen in which the existence is indispensable in lethal PMWS.
Effective immune response to pathogens other than PCV2 is insufficient in PMWS contracted pigs.
With regard to the immunosuppressive state in PMWS, based on clinical, pathological and immunological observations observed in the field, PCV2 may be an important factor for secondarily occurring immunodeficiency, possibly under certain circumstances.
The authors carried out a collection survey in the rocky shore in the northern area of Ibaraki Prefecture.
Large-sized species were collected directly, while small-sized species were collected from hand-networks and bottom soil through sieves.
As for small crustaceans, Acanthomysis mitsukurii of Mysidacea, and Nippon caprellid and Tsugal caprellid of caprellids were confirmed for the first time in Ibaraki Prefecture.
The large crustaceans were 2 species of 2 families of pedicel, 3 species of pedicel, and 10 species of decapod.
The number of species was small because the survey was restricted to the intertidal zone.
This paper shows collected species, collection sites, and collection date including the survey results until now.

Covariance structure analysis revealed that the direct effect of social capital (production activation effect) was high in cities and regions other than suburbs.
The following are outlined on swordfish in North Atlantic Ocean for recent one year: Movement, utilization and application, outline of fishery, biological characteristics, resources situation, and control measures.
The catch of the world for recent 5 years was 9552-12283 tons.
In SCRS of ICCAT in 2002, resources evaluation was carried out by VPA and nonequilibrium production model using resources index estimated from longline fishing data of each country.
Both analytical results show good recruitment after 1997 and resources recovery by the decrease in the catch, and the good entry is expected in the future, if the excessive fish catch is refrained.

For idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patient of 14 examples and patient of 8 examples hospitalized of the IPF acute aggravation, virus inspection and immunoserologic inspection were enforced on BALF and blood fimbria.
The cytokine which significantly increased in BALF in comparison with the IPF climax in acute aggravation stage was measured 17 kinds insect of 13 types, and especially, IL-6, TNFα, IFNγ showed the high tendency in the poor prognosis example.
In 3 examples of reexamining BALF during the acute aggravation treatment progress, the tendency in which IL-2, IL-5, IL-6 lowered by the treatment without relating to the prognosis was shown, and IL-8, IFNγ, TNFα showed the upward trend in the poor prognosis example.
IL ‐ 6, IL ‐ 7, IL ‐ 8 and IL ‐ 10 levels in the blood were significantly higher in the acute exacerbation than in the stable phase.
The basic disease state of the bronchial fimbria is the chronic air duct inflammation.
In the air duct inflammation, many cells such as eosinophil, T cell, mast cell, neutrophils, macrophage, airway epithelium and various liquid factors are concerned.
It is taken seriously that the Th2 cytokine is concerned even in not only central air duct but also peripheral air duct on the position of the air duct inflammation.
In addition, the disease state of the air duct remodeling of peeling and fimbria cell, basement membrane hyperplasia, hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the air duct smooth muscle, angiogenesis of the air duct epithelial cell is clarified, and the irreversible air duct blockage is brought about, and the air duct anaphylaxia is chronically advanced, and it becomes a cause of seriousness and inveterateness of the fimbria.
It is important to introduce the antiphlogistic mainly on the inhalation steroid medicine from the early stage in order to suppress the remodeling of the air duct in addition to the control of allergic bronchitis for the treatment of the fimbria.
Bronchial fimbriae is characterized by repeated occurrences of paroxysmal calling, dyspnea and cough, which tend to appear at night and early in the morning, and is continuous rale sound, especially high-harmonic whistle-like sound, in the auscultation opinion.
In addition, objective evaluation of the air flow restriction by the respiratory function test is necessary for the diagnosis of the fimbria.
It is evaluated by spirometry and peak flow meter, and the air duct anaphylaxia test is carried out.
The evaluation of the air duct inflammation is carried out by inspection of the fimbria, nitrogen monoxide concentration measurement in the expiration, expiration condensate measurement, allergic test besides.
The diseases causing rumbling and dyspnea such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, left heart failure, hyperventilation syndrome, etc. become an object of the differentiation.
It is important in clinical diagnosis that 1) the symptom which derives from the air flow restriction occurs in the paroxysmal repeatability, 2) there is the reversibility at least partially in the air flow restriction, 3) other diseases are excluded.
As a result of our genetic analysis, the possibility of fulfiling the important role in the disease state of the fimbria was guessed the IL-17F gene.
PAI-1 It may be deeply concerned in the formation of the remodeling of the air duct, and the functional polymorphism of the PAI-1 gene seems to be one of the genetic factors which regulate whether the remodeling of the air duct is easy to progress.
CCL5 is a chemokine strongly induced from the airway epithelium in the viral infection, and especially, it may fulfil the important role for the acquisition of the chronic airway inflammation in the elderly fimbria.
It was guessed that the natural immunity system was deeply concerned in the disease state of the allergy, when the role of the macrophage random migration inhibitor was noticed.
The understanding of the disease deepened by clarifying the pathophysiological common route from them at the molecular level.
By making these routes to be a target, it wants to expect that it contributes to the advance on treatment and prevention of the fimbria.
