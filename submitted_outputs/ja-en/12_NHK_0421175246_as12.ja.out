This paper describes a new theory on the glass transition temperature from crosslinked resin to linear polymer by the author.
The author has already announced the paper on the title of \"new theory on the physical property from crosslinked resin to linear polymer: melting point, glass transition point (Tg) and strength\" in J. Applied Polymer Science (Vol.97, 1467 - 1475 (2005)).
In the new theory, the cross - linking resin forms different segments depending on the curing and post - curing temperatures, and the g also changes.
The glass transition temperature (Tg) of the linear polymer was assumed to be a segment of two rows of bonds bonded by van der Waals force between the main chains, and the thermal elongation of the C - C bond from 0 ℃ was 1%.
In order to explain these new theories, this paper describes \"elongation\", \"difference between Tg and segment of crosslinked resin and linear polymer\", \"relation between melting and molecular size\", \"relation between Tg and new segment\", and \"handling of linear expansion coefficient\".

The sweating rate by the hand grip (for 5 seconds in maximum grip strength) in HDT was significantly lower in sitting position than in the case without the back oppression, but there was no difference in the mental calculation load.
These results suggest that sweating during HDT is different between mental and exercise loads.
In the normal cell, the telomere is shortened, when it is divided, and the cell senesens, when some extreme value is exceeded.
In the meantime, in cancer cell and immortalization cell, the telomere is supplemented, since there is the telomerase activity, and the fixed length is kept without further shortening, and the infinite proliferation ability is acquired.
Therefore, the gene which controls the telomerase activity is regarded as one candidate of the cellular aging induction gene.
These results suggest the existence of an unknown telomerase regulatory gene on chromosome 3, 3p14 → p21.

This paper outlines the immune system of pigs and the complicated interaction of PCV2.
This paper introduces the evidence that PCV2 is the main pig pathogen under appropriate environment and management conditions.
Extensive stimulation of the immune system is one of the essential conditions to induce postweaning multiorgan wasting syndrome (PMWS) in PCV2 infected pigs.
And, PCV2 itself is the pathogen in which the existence is indispensable in lethal PMWS.
In the PMWS infected pig, the effective immune response to the pathogen except for PCV2 is insufficient.
On the immunosuppressive condition in PMWS, based on clinical, pathological and immunological observations observed in the field, PCV2 may be an important factor of secondarily occurring immunodeficiency under a certain environment.

For idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patient of 14 cases and patient of 8 cases who were hospitalized of the IPF acute aggravation, virus inspection and immunoserologic inspection were enforced on BALF and blood.
The cytokine which significantly increased in BALF in comparison with the IPF climax in acute exacerbation stage was measured 17 kinds of insects of 13 types, and especially, IL-6, TNFα, IFNγ showed the high tendency in the poor prognosis example.
In 3 cases in which BALF was able to be reexamined during the acute aggravation treatment progress, IL-2, IL-5, IL-6 showed the declining tendency without relating to the prognosis by the treatment, and IL-8, IFNγ, TNFα showed the rising tendency in the poor prognosis example.
Plasma IL - 6, IL - 7, IL - 8 and IL - 10 levels were significantly elevated during acute exacerbation compared with those during stable phase.
The basic disease state of bronchial asthma is chronic airway inflammation.
In the air duct inflammation, many cells such as eosinophil, T cell, mast cell, neutrophils, macrophage, air duct epithelium and various liquid factors are concerned.
It is taken seriously that the Th2 cytokine is concerned even in not only central air duct but also peripheral air duct on the position of the air duct inflammation.
In addition, the disease state of air duct remodeling such as peeling and cell formation, basement membrane hyperplasia, hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the air duct smooth muscle, angiogenesis of the air duct epithelial cell is clarified, and the irreversible airway closure is brought about, and the air duct anaphylaxia is made to advance in the chronic air duct anaphylaxia, and it becomes a cause of seriousness and inveterateness of the breath.
It is important that the anti-inflammatory drug mainly on the inhalation steroid medicine is introduced from the early stage in order to suppress the remodeling of the air duct in addition to the control of allergic bronchitis for the treatment of breathing.
In the auscultation opinion, it is characterized that it is easy to appear in night and early morning by repeating stridor, dyspnea, cough of the paroxysmal, and it is the continuous sound, especially the high tone whistle like sound.
In addition, objective evaluation of the air flow restriction by the respiratory function test is necessary for the diagnosis of apnea.
It is evaluated by spirometry and peak flow meter, and the air duct anaphylaxia test is carried out.
The evaluation of the air duct inflammation is carried out by bending test, nitrogen monoxide concentration measurement in the expiration, expiration condensate measurement, and in addition, allergological inspection.
The disease which causes stridor and dyspnea such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, left heart failure, hyperventilation syndrome becomes an object of the differentiation.
It is important in the clinical diagnosis that 1) the symptom which derives from the air flow restriction occurs in the paroxysmal repeatability, 2) there is the reversibility at least partially in the air flow restriction, 3) other disease is excluded.
As a result of our genetic analysis, the possibility in which the IL-17F gene fulfiled the important role in the disease state of breath was guessed.
PAI-1 may be deeply concerned in the formation of the remodeling of the air duct, and the functional polymorphism of the PAI-1 gene seems to be one of the genetic factors which regulate whether the remodeling of the air duct is easy to progress.
CCL5 is chemokine strongly induced from the airway epithelium in the viral infection, and especially, it may fulfil the important role for the acquisition of the chronic airway inflammation in old people.
It was guessed that the natural immunity system was deeply concerned in the disease state of the allergy, when the role of the macrophage migration inhibiting factor was noticed.
The understanding of the disease deepened by clarifying the pathophysiological common route from them at the molecular level.
By making these routes to be a target, it is expected that it contributes to the advance on prevention and treatment.
