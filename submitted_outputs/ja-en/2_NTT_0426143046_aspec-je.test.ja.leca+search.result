This paper proposes a real-time phase stamp range finder (RT-PSRF) using a three-phase correlation image sensor (3PCIS).

The 3PCIS stamps the phase of the reference signal at the moment the optical stripes are imaged on each pixcels while a single scanning is performed with the sheet beam.
Thus, three-dimensional shapes of an object can be obtained in real time by converting the detected phase to the angle of the projected sheet beam.
Compared with a time-stamp VLSI range finder, the PSRF is less sensitive to the spatial ununiformity of the surface reflection of the object and the background illumination.

The author\'s new theory on the glass transition point from crosslinked resin to linear polymer is described.
The author has already published the paper in the title of \"new theory on physical properties from crosslinked resin to linear polymer: Melting point, glass transition point (Tg) and strength\" in J. Applied Polymer Science (Vol.97, 1467-1475 (2005)).
In the new theory, g also changes, because the crosslinked resin forms the different segment by the temperature of curing and post-curing.
And, the TG of linear polymer was made to be the temperature in which the thermal elongation rate of the C-C bond from 0 °C was 1%, considering the bond part of 2 rows which were combined by the van der Waals force between main chains as a segement.
This paper describes \"elongation\", \"differences of Tg and segment between crosslinked resin and linear polymer\", \"relation between melting and molecular size\", \"relation between post-Tg and new segment\", and \"handling of linear expansion coefficient\" to explain these new theory.

We have demonstrated that the ion range at the target can be controlled by the distance from the beam window to the target using an irradiation device for the cell connected to the beam line of a 3MV tandem accelerator.
The effect of penetrating power controlled irradiation on tobacco pollen as a model cell system for local irradiation was investigated.
“Leaky pollen\", probably due to cell membrane damage, was frequently observed at the end of the ion range.
When heavy ion‐irradiated, dried pollen (20μm) was dyed with acetocarmine, leaky pollen was observed, but not with gamma ray‐irradiated pollen.
The effect of he and C ion on the frequency of the pollen with the leakage at some distances from the beam window was shown in the figure.
For both ions, the frequency increased linearly with ion‐fluence, butC ion ( LET800keV/μm in the cell surface ) was more effective thanHe ion ( the same 180keV/μm ).
The effect of the peristaltic flow in 3D TOF MRA angiography was examined by the experiment using the phantom.
In the peristaltic flow, the signal intensity in the fluid part (especially, near the inflow part) was lower than that in the steady flow due to the effect of the signal lowering by the phase dispersion.
The signal lowering by the peristaltic flow was obvious in the flexal of stenotic region and blood vessels.
A ghost artifact due to peristaltic flow was observed, and the interval was proportional to the repeating time and the pulse rate.

As a simulation of the microgravity of the left pollex, the sweating amount was measured continuously using head down tilt (HDT) which lowered the head by 6 degrees from the horizon in the bed by fixing the probe in the flat side of the left pollex.
The sweat rate by the handgrip (for 5 seconds at the largest grasping power) in HDT significantly lowered in the sitting position in comparison with the case without the back oppression, and in the mental calculation load, the difference could not be recognized.
These results suggest that sweating during HDT is different between psychogenic load and exercising load.
In normal cells, the telomere is shortened every time it divides, and when it exceeds a certain extreme value, the cell senesces.
In the meantime, in tumor cells and immortalized cells, telomere is supplemented, since there is the telomerase activity, and the fixed length is kept without shortening further, and the unlimited multiplication ability is acquired.
Therefore, the gene which controls the telomerase activity is regarded as one candidate of the cellular aging induction gene.
The possibility of the existence of an unknown telomerase controlling gene on3 chromosome 3p14→p21 was indicated.
The active electrode with the transmission function which deduced the surface myogenic potential without using pretreatment and conductive paste of the skin was produced experimentally.

Subjective symptoms of coolness and pain in the right lower leg were recognized, and ulcers with necrotic tissues appeared in the right anterior shin bone afterwards, which were gradually exacerbated.
The pain was relieved, when 10μg/day of L was infused for 4 weeks with wound treatments such as the cleaning of the ulcer division, and the ulcers of the lower leg were reduced.
During the treatment, the side effect was not recognized.
CGRP is secreted from the sensory nerve region to the heart muscle.
48‐hour administration of CGRP increased the surface area of new born rat myocardial cells by about 2‐fold.
In addition, CGRP also up‐regulates the mRNA expression for skeletal muscle α actin and atrial natriuresis peptide.
These results suggest that CGRP is a potent hypertrophic factor for myocardial cells.

This paper outlines the complicated interaction between pig immune system and PCV2.
This paper introduces the evidence that PCV2 is a main pig pathogen under appropriate environment and management conditions.
Extensive stimulation of the immune system is an essential condition to inducepig multiorgan-underdeveloped after weaning syndrome(PMWS) in PCV2-infected pigs.
And, PCV2 itself is the pathogen in which the existence is indispensable in lethal PMWS.
Effective immunological response to pathogens other than PCV2 is insufficient in PMWS-contracted pigs.
On the immunosuppressive condition in PMWS, PCV2 may be an important factor of the secondary immunodeficiency under some fixed environments, based on the clinic, pathological and immunological observation recognized in the field.

In 3 cases which were able to reexamine BALF during the acute aggravation treating process, the tendency in which IL-2, IL-5 and IL-6 lowered by the treatment regardless of the prognosis was shown, and IL-8, IFNγ and TNFα showed the upward trend in the poor prognosis cases.
In the blood plasma, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8 and IL-10 significantly rose in the acute aggravation stage in comparison with the stable stage.
The basic disease state of the bronchial asthma is the chronic and airway inflammation.
In the airway inflammation, many cells such as eosinophils, T-cells, mast cells, neutrophilss, macrophages, and airway epithelium, and various liquid factors are involved.
It is taken seriously that the Th2 cytokine is concerned even in not only central airway but also peripheral airway on the position of the airway inflammation.
In addition, the disease states of airway remodeling such as peeling and turning into embryonic cell, basal membrane thickening, hypertrophy and hyperplasia of tracheal smooth muscle, and angiogenesis of tracheal epithelial cell are clarified, and the irreversible airway closure is brought about, and the airway anaphylaxia is chronically exacerbated, and it becomes a cause of seriousness and inveterateness of the asthma.
For the treatment of asthma, it is important to introduce antiinflammatory drugs such as inhalation steroids from the early stage in order to suppress the remodeling of the airway in addition to the control of allergic inflammation.
The bronchial asthma is characterized by the repetition of paroxysmal stridor, dyspnea and cough, which are easy to appear in night and early morning, and in the auscultation finding, it is continuous rales, especially the harmonic flute-like sound.
In addition, the objective evaluation of the air flow restriction by the respiratory function test is necessary for the diagnosis of the asthma.
It is evaluated by spirometry and peak flow meter, and the airway hypersensitivity test is carried out.
The evaluation of the airway inflammation is carried out by sputum test, nitrogen monoxide concentration in the expiration, expiration condensate measurement, allergological examination besides.
The diseases which cause stridor and dyspnea such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, insufficiency of left heart and hyperventilation syndrome become an object of the differentiation.
It is important in the clinical diagnosis that 1) the symptom which derives from the air flow restriction occurs paroxysmally and repeatedly, 2) there is the reversibility at least partially in the air flow restriction, 3) other diseases are excluded.
As a result of our genetic analysis, the possibility of fulfiling the important role in the disease state of the asthma was guessed the IL-17F gene.
PAI-1 may be deeply involved in the formation in the remodeling of the airway, and the functional polymorphism of the PAI-1 gene seems to be one of the genetic factors which regulate whether the remodeling of the airway is easy to progress.
CCL5 is a chemokine strongly induced from the airway epithelium in the viral infection, and especially, it may fulfil the important role for the acquisition of the chronic airway inflammation in high-age asthma.
It was guessed that the natural immune system was deeply concerned in the disease state of the allergy, when the role of the macrophage inhibitory factor was noticed.
The understanding of the disease deepened by clarifying the pathophysiological and common pathway from them at the molecular level.
By making these routes to be a target, it wants to expect that it contributes to the advance on prevention and treatment of asthma.
