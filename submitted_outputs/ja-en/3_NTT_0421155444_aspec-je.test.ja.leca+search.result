This paper describes a new theory on the glass transition point from crosslinked resin to linear polymer by the author.
The author has already announced the titled paper of \"new theory on physical properties from crosslinked resin to linear polymer: Melting point, glass transition point (Tg) and strength\" in J. Applied Polymer Science (Vol.97, 1467-1475 (2005).
In the new theory, G also changes, because the crosslinked resin forms the segment which differs by the temperature of curing and post-curing.
And, the TG of linear polymer was made to be a temperature of 1% thermal elongation rate of the C-C bond from 0 ° C, considering the bond part of 2 segements combined by the van der Waals force between main chains as a segment.
In order to explain these new theory, this paper describes \"elongation\", \"differences of Tg and segment between crosslinked resin and linear polymer\", \"relation between melting and molecular size\", \"relation between post-Tg and new segment\", and \"handling of linear expansion coefficient\".

As a simulation of the microgravity, head down tilt (HDT) which lowered the head by 6 degrees from the horizon in the bed was used, and the sweating amount was continuously measured by fixing the probe in the flat side of the left pollex.
Though the sweat rate by the hand grip (for 5 seconds at the largest grasping power) in HDT significantly lowered in the sitting position in comparison with the case without the back oppression, in the mental calculation load, the difference could not be recognized.
These results suggest that sweating during HDT is different between psychogenic load and exercising load.
In normal cells, the telomere is shortened when it divides, and the cell senesces when it exceeds a certain extreme value.
On the other hand, in tumor cells and immortalized cells, telomere is supplemented because of telomerase activity, and unlimited multiplication ability is acquired by keeping a fixed length without further shortening.
Therefore, the gene which controls the telomerase activity regards it as one candidacy for the cellular aging induction gene.
These results suggest the presence of an unknown telomerase controlling gene on3 chromosome 3p14→p21.

Basic disease state of the bronchial asthma is the chronic airway inflammation.
Many cells such as eosinophils, T-cells, mast cells, neutrophils, macrophages, airway epithelium and various liquid factors are involved in the airway inflammation.
It is taken seriously that the Th2 cytokine is concerned even in not only central airway but also peripheral airway on the position of the airway inflammation.
In addition, the disease states of airway remodeling such as peeling of tracheal epithelial cell and turning into embryonic cell, basal membrane thickening, hypertrophy and hyperplasia of airway smooth muscle, and angiogenesis are clarified, and the irreversible airway closure is brought about, and the airway anaphylaxia is chronically advanced, and it becomes a cause of seriousness and inveterateness of the asthma tracheal smooth muscle.
For the treatment of asthma, it is important to introduce antiinflammatory drugs such as inhalation steroids from the early stage in order to suppress the remodeling of the airway in addition to the control of allergic inflammation.
Bronchial asthma is characterized by repeated paroxysmal stridor, dyspnea and cough, and these are easy to appear in night and early morning, and in the auscultation finding, it is continuous rales, especially harmonic flute-like sound.
In addition, the objective evaluation of the air flow restriction by the respiratory function test is necessary for the diagnosis of the asthma.
It is evaluated by spirometry and peak flow meter, and the airway hypersensitivity test is carried out.
The evaluation of the airway inflammation is carried out in sputum test, nitrogen monoxide concentration in the expiration, expiration condensate measurement, allergological examination besides.
The diseases which cause stridor and dyspnea such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, insufficiency of left heart, and hyperventilation syndrome are the objects of the differentiation.
It is important in the clinical diagnosis that 1) the symptom which derives from the air flow restriction occurs paroxysmally and repeatedly, 2) there is the reversibility at least partially in the air flow restriction, 3) other diseases are excluded.
As a result of our genetic analysis, the possibility of fulfiling the important role in the disease state of the asthma was guessed the IL-17F gene.
PAI-1 may be deeply involved in the formation of the remodeling of the airway, and the functional polymorphism of the PAI-1 gene seems to be one of the genetic factors which regulate whether the remodeling of the airway is easy to progress.
CCL5 is a chemokine strongly induced from the airway epithelium in the viral infection, and especially, it may fulfil the important role for the acquisition of the chronic airway inflammation in high-age asthma.
It was guessed that the natural immune system was deeply concerned in the disease state of the allergy, when the role of the macrophage inhibitory factor was noticed.
From them, the understanding of the disease deepened by clarifying the pathophysiological and common pathway at the molecular level.
By making these routes to be a target, it wants to expect contributing to the advance on prevention and treatment of asthma.
