This paper describes a new theory of glass transition point from crosslinked resin to linear polymer.
The author has already announced the paper on the subject of \"new theory on physical properties from crosslinked resin to linear polymer: melting point, glass transition point (Tg) and strength\" in J. Applied Polymer Science (Vol.97, 1467 - 1475 (2005)).
In the new theory, g also changes, because crosslinked resin forms different segment by curing temperature and post-curing temperature.
And, the thermal elongation from 0 ℃ of the C-C bond was made to be 1% temperature on Tg of linear polymer, considering the segement of the bond part of 2 rows combined by van der Waals force between main chains.
This paper describes \"elongation\", \"differences of Tg and segment between crosslinked resin and linear polymer\", \"relation between melting and molecular size\", \"relation between post-Tg and new segment\", and \"handling of linear expansion coefficient\" in order to explain these new theory.

The basic disease state of bronchial asthma is chronic airway inflammation.
Many cells such as eosinophils, T-cells, mast cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and airway epithelium and various liquid factors are involved in airway inflammation.
It is taken seriously that Th2 cytokine is concerned even in not only central airway but also peripheral airway on the position of airway inflammation.
In airway anaphylaxia ddition, the disease states of airway remodeling such as peeling of tracheal epithelial cell and turning into embryonic cell, basal membrane thickening, hypertrophy and hyperplasia of tracheal smooth muscle, angiogenesis are clarified, and irreversible airway closure is brought about, and the air duct anaphylaxia is chronically advanced, and it becomes a cause of seriousness and inveterateness of asthma.
For the treatment of asthma, it is important to introduce antiinflammatory drugs such as inhalation steroids from the early stage in order to suppress the remodeling of airway in addition to the control of allergic inflammation.
The bronchial asthma is generated by the repetition of paroxysmal stridor, dyspnea and cough, and it is made that these are easy to appear in night and early morning to be features, and in the auscultation finding, it is the continuous stridor, especially the harmonic flute-like sound.
In addition, objective evaluation of air flow restriction by respiratory function test is necessary for diagnosis of asthma.
It is evaluated by spirometry and peak flow meter, and airway hypersensitivity test is carried out.
Evaluation of airway inflammation is carried out by sputum test, measurement of nitrogen monoxide concentration in the expiration, measurement of expiration condensate, and allergological examination.
The diseases which cause stridor and dyspnea such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, insufficiency of left heart, hyperventilation syndrome, etc. become an object of the differentiation.
It is important in the clinical diagnosis that 1) the symptom which derives from the air flow restriction occurs paroxysmally and repeatedly, 2) there is the reversibility at least in the air flow restriction, 3) other diseases are excluded.
As a result of our genetic analysis, the possibility in which the IL-17F gene fulfiled the important role in the disease state of asthma was guessed.
PAI-1 may be deeply involved in the formation of airway remodeling, and the functional polymorphism of PAI-1 gene is considered to be one of the genetic factors which regulate whether airway remodeling is easy to progress.
CCL5 is chemokine strongly induced from airway epithelium in viral infection, and especially, it may play an important role in acquisition of chronic airway inflammation in high-age asthma.
It was guessed that natural immune system was deeply concerned in disease state of the allergy, when the role of macrophage inhibitory factor y factor was noticed.
The understanding of the disease deepened by clarifying the pathophysiological common pathway at the molecular level.
By making these routes to be a target, it is expected to contribute to the advance on prevention and treatment of asthma.
