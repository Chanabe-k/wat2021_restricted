The author\'s new theory on the glass transition point from crosslinked resin to linear polymer is described.
The author has already published the titled paper of \"new theory on physical properties from crosslinked resin to linear polymer: Melting point, glass transition point (Tg) and strength\" in J.Applied Polymer Science (Vol.97, 1467-1475 (2005)).
In the new theory, g is also changed, because the crosslinked resin forms a different segment by the temperature of curing and after curing.
And, TG of linear polymer was assumed to be segement of two rows of van der Waals force between main chains, and thermal elongation of the C-C bond from 0 °C was set to be 1%.
In order to explain this new theory, this paper describes \"elongation\", \"differences of Tg and segment between crosslinked resin and linear polymer\", \"relation between melting and molecular size\", \"relation between post-Tg and new segment\", and \"handling of linear expansion coefficient\".

The effect of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) on intestinum tenue was examined concerning form and function.
The nucleus/cell ratio in the epithelial cells of the small intestinal villus tended to increase by TCDD treatment.
As a result of examining the effect on the glucose absorption power, the glucose absorption power in intestinum tenue increased in the TCDD exposed C57BL/6J mouse.
Possibilities such as the increase of sugar transporter SGLUT1 and glucose transporter 2mRNA, the increase of the SGLUT1 protein, and the increase of lactase and maltase activities are indicated.
The promotion of the glucose absorption power was suggested to be a mechanism to compensate for the decrease of the internal sugar utilization efficiency by dioxin.

The effect of penetrating power controlled irradiation on tobacco pollen as a model cell system for local irradiation was investigated.
\"The pollen with the leakage\" which seemed to originate from the cell membrane damage was observed high-frequent in the terminal of the ion range.
When dried pollen (20 μm) heavy ion‐irradiated was dyed with acetocarmine, there was a leaky pollen, but not with gamma ray‐irradiated pollen.
The effects of he and C ion on the frequency of leaked pollen at several distances from the beam window are illustrated.
C ions (LET800keV/μm at cell surface) were more effective thanHe ion ( the same 180keV/μm ), although the frequency increased linearly with the ion‐fluence for both ions.C ion ( LET800keV/μm in the cell surface ) was more effective than he ion (180keV/μm).
We examined the effect of peristaltic flow on 3D TOF MRA angiography using a phantom.
In the pulse flow, the signal intensity in the fluid part (especially in the peristaltic flow) was lower than that in the steady flow due to the effect of the signal lowering by the phase dispersion.
The signal lowering by the peristaltic flow was obvious in stenotic region and flexal of blood vessels.
The interval between ghost artifacts due to peristaltic flow was proportional to the repeating time and the pulse rate.

This suggests that fractal analysis is more suitable for detecting changes in induction quantity than peaks.
It is a problem that a balance of the autonomic nervous function is hurt by exposing to the microgravity.
As a simulation of the microgravity, head down tilt (HDT) which lowered the head horizon 6 degrees in the bed was used, and sweating amount was continuously measured by fixing the probe on flat side of the left pollex.
Sweat rate by the handgrip (for 5 seconds in largest grasping power) in HDT significantly lowered in sitting position in comparison with the case without the back oppression, but in the mental calculation load, the difference could not be recognized.
These results suggest that sweating during HDT differs between psychogenic load and exercising load.
The telomere is shortened, when it divides in the normal cells, and the cell senes when it exceeds some extrema.
On the other hand, in tumor cells and immortalized cells, telomere is complemented because of telomerase activity, and unlimited multiplication ability is acquired without further shortening.
Therefore, the gene which controls the telomerase activity is regarded as one candidacy for the cellular aging induction gene.
The possibility that unknown telomerase controlling gene exists on3 chromosome 3p14→p21 is indicated.
An active electrode with transmission function for deriving surface myogenic potential without using skin pretreatment or conductive paste was produced experimentally.

And, there was a case in which there was little correlation with the case in which there is the high correlation between normalization dispersion value and dispersion of heart rate of emotional sweating quantity under program preparation.
Further experiments seemed to be necessary.
The complicated interaction of immune system and PCV2 of the pig was outlined.
This paper introduces the evidence that PCV2 is the main pathogen of pigs under appropriate environment and management conditions.
Extensive stimulation of the immune system is an essential condition to inducepig multiorgan-underdeveloped after weaning syndrome(PMWS) in PCV2-infected pigs.
And, PCV2 itself is a pathogen in which the existence is indispensable in lethal PMWS.
In PMWS-contracted pigs, effective immunological response to pathogens other than PCV2 is insufficient.
With regard to the immunosuppressive state in PMWS, PCV2 may be an important factor for secondary immunodeficiency under certain environments, probably based on clinic, pathological and immunological observation observed in the field.

The basic disease state of bronchial asthma is chronic airway inflammation.
In the airway inflammation, many cells such as eosinophils, T-cells, mast cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and airway epithelium, and various liquid factors are involved.
It is taken seriously that the Th2 cytokine is concerned even in not only central airway but also peripheral airway on the position of the airway inflammation.
In addition, the disease states of airway remodeling such as peeling and turning into embryonic cell, basal membrane thickening, hypertrophy and hyperplasia of airway smooth muscle, and angiogenesis of tracheal epithelial cell are clarified, and irreversible airway closure is brought about, and airway anaphylaxia is chronically promoted, and it becomes a cause of seriousness and intractability of asthma tracheal smooth muscle.
For the treatment of the turf asthma, it is important to introduce the antiinflammatory drugs mainly on the inhalation steroids from the early stage in order to suppress the remodeling of the airway in addition to the control of the allergic inflammation.
The bronchial asthma is characterized by the repetitive occurrence of paroxysmal stridor, dyspnea and cough, which are easy to appear at night and early morning, and it is the continuous rale, especially the harmonic flute-like sound in the auscultation finding.
In addition, the objective evaluation of the air flow restriction by the respiratory function test is necessary for the diagnosis of the asthma.
It is evaluated by spirometry and peak flow meter, and the airway hypersensitivity test is carried out.
The evaluation of the airway inflammation is carried out by sputum test, nitrogen monoxide concentration in the expiration, expiration condensate measurement, and allergological examination.
The diseases which cause stridor and dyspnea such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, insufficiency of left heart, and hyperventilation syndrome are the object of the differentiation.
It is important in the clinical diagnosis that 1) the symptom which derives from the air flow restriction occurs paroxysmally and repeatedly, 2) there is the reversibility at least partially in the air flow restriction, 3) other diseases are excluded.
As a result of our genetic analysis, the possibility that the IL-17F gene fulfils the important role in the disease state of the turf asthma is guessed.
PAI-1 It may be deeply involved in the formation of the remodeling of the airway, and the functional polymorphism of the PAI-1 gene seems to be one of the genetic factors which regulate whether the remodeling of the airway is easy to progress.
CCL5 is a chemokine which is strongly induced from the airway epithelium in the viral infection, and especially, it may fulfil the important role for the acquisition of the chronic airway inflammation in high-age asthma.
It was guessed that the natural immune system was deeply concerned in the disease state of the allergy, when the role of the macrophage inhibitory factor was noticed.
The understanding of the disease deepened by clarifying the pathophysiological and common pathway from them at the molecular level.
By targeting these pathways, it is expected to contribute to the advance of asthma prevention and treatment of asthma.
