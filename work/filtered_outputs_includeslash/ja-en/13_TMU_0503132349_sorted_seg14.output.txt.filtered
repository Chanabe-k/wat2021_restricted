DHPLC classification by direct sequence method ( M1 〜 causative genes of this M ( M5 ) , identification method of direct sequence method as M causative genes , classification and DHPLC utilization are explained .
M gene is characterized by is a gene by the abnormality of pancreas β-cells by the abnormality of hyposecretion of insulin by pancreatic β cell .
M gene , however , the abnormality of M gene discovered until now is about 20 % of M , and the remaining part is unknown .

cerebral parenchyma of PVS showed opinions such as the limbic was fundamentally arranged , clear , the boundary was clear , the change in the circumference , the largest diameter ofmm or less , and the artery in the brain parenchyma .
agingVS expand with PVS a aging .
medullary artery in patients with multiple lacunar infarction cases PVS was markedly dilated .
expansion in the cases with hypertension , the expansion of hypertension expansion was further strengthened .
medullary arteriosclerosis in these findings suggest that PVS is more expanded in the medullary artery with the progression of medullary arteriosclerosis .

chronic basic disease state of bronchial asthmachial basic disease state of bronchial breath is airway inflammation chronic .

airway inflammation is regarded as important that the peripheral airway cytokine is concerned not only Th2 cytokine on the position of airway inflammation in central airway airway but also peripheral airway.way inflammation .
tracheal epithelial cell turning into embryonic cell , airway remodeling such as tracheal smooth muscle , angiogenesis , and chronically irreversible airway closure is brought about , and disease states of asthma , hyperplasia and hyperplasia of airway closure , basal membrane thickening , and airway anaphylaxia , and it becomes a cause of seriousness and intractable breath .
inhalation steroids are important to suppress the remodeling of anti-inflammatory drugs in addition to the control of allergic inflammation in the airway , and the antiinflammatory drugs are introduced from the early stage for the asthmatic breath in the control of allergic inflammation .
auscultation finding is characterized that the bronchial lining occurs repeatedly by paroxysmal stridor , dyspnea and cough of bronchial asthma , and it is a continuous harmonic flute-like sound , especially the higheristle-like sound .
asthma , diagnosis of the evaluation of respiratory function test by air flow restriction is necessary objective evaluation for the diagnosis of the breath .
peak flow meter are evaluated by spirometry and airway hypersensitivity test by peak flow meter , and spirometry , and airway anaphylaxia test is carried out .
airway inflammation is evaluated by allergological examination is carried out by nitrogen monoxide concentration in the expiration sputum test , nitrogen monoxide concentration measurement in the expiration condensate , expiration condensate measurement , and in addition , allergic examination .
differentiation is an object of the disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , obstructive lung disease , hyperventilation syndrome , etc . , as chronic obstructive lung disease , insufficiency of left heart , and stridor and dyspnea of dyspnea diseases .
paroxysmally and repeatedly important to exclude other air flow restriction , 2 ) partially reversible in symptom derived from air flow restriction , 2 ) partially reversibility at least , and 3 ) other diseases are excluded in clinical diagnosis .
IL-17F gene result of the asthma fulfiled the important role of our genetic analysis .
formation of remodeling of air duct , and the functional polymorphism may be deeply involved in airway remodeling , and it seems to be one of genetic factors that regulate whether remodeling of PAI-1 gene is easy to progress or not remodeling of air duct or not regulates the functional polymorphism of airway PAI-1 gene .
CCL5 is the chemokine which is induced from theCL5 is strongly induced from the airway epithelium in the viral infection in the viral infection , and especially , it may fulfil the role which is important for the acquisition of chronic airway inflammation in high-age asthma , chemokine , which is important for the acquisition of chronic airway inflammation in the goal of the elderly .
macrophage inhibitory factor was guessed that the natural immune system was deeply concerned in the allergy in the disease state , when the role of the natural immune system was deeply concerned , when the role of the macrophage migration inhibitory factor was noticed .
pathophysiological understanding of the disease is deepened by the molecular level of the disease pathophysiological common pathway , and the path of disease path is clarified at the molecular level .
prevention and treatment of asthma by making these routes to be a target to contribute to the advance on treatment .
