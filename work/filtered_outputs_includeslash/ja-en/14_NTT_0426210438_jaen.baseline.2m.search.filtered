This paper proposes a phase-stamp range finder (PSRF) using a three-phase correlation image sensor (3PCIS) for real-time phase stamp range finder (RT-PSRF).
Except for 3PCIS and a three-phase reference signal generator, it is composed of the same parts as conventional light stripe and range finder.The three-phase reference signal generator is composed of a light stripe and a range finder, and the three-phase reference signal generator is composed of a light stripe and a range finder, and the three-phase reference signal generator is composed of a light stripe and a range finder, and the three-phase reference signal generator is composed of a light stripe and a range finder, and the three-phase reference signal generator is composed of a light stripe and a range finder, and a range finder are composed of the three-phase reference signal generator from RT-PSRFIS to optical stripe range finder.
While a single scanning is performed with a sheet beam, 3PCIS stamps the phase of the reference signal at the moment when the optical stripes are picturized on each pixcels.
Thus, by converting the detected phase into the angle of the projected sheet beam, three-dimensional shapes of the object can be obtained in real time.
Compared with a time-stamp VLSI range finder, PSRF is less sensitive to spatial ununiformity of surface reflection of an object and background illumination.
The structure of the proposed PSRF is simpler than that of the modulated PSRF.
