The basic disease state of the bronchial asthma is chronic airway inflammation.
Many cells and various liquid factors including eosinophils, T-cells, mast cells, neutrophils, macrophages, airway epithelium, etc. are concerned in the airway inflammation.
It is regarded to be important that the Th2 cytokine is concerned not only in the central airway but also in the peripheral airway as a part of the airway inflammation.
airway remodeling disease states asthma airway closure irreversible airway anaphylaxia chronically hyperplasia and angiogenesis, basal membrane thickening, tracheal epithelial cell detachment and turning into embryonic cell, hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the tracheal smooth muscle, etc. become clear in addition, and it becomes a cause of seriousness and intractable asthma.
For the treatment of asthma, antiinflammatory drugs mainly on inhalation steroids are important to suppress the remodeling of airway in addition to the control of allergic inflammation.
The bronchial asthma is characterized by repeated paroxysmal stridor, dyspnea and cough, harmonic flute-like sound, which are easy to appear in night and early morning, and is continuous razor, especially, high tone flute-like sound in the auscultation finding.
In addition, objective evaluation of air flow restriction by the respiratory function test is necessary for the diagnosis of asthma.
It is evaluated by spirometry and peak flow meter, and airway hypersensitivity test is carried out.
Evaluation of airway inflammation is carried out by sputum test, nitrogen monoxide concentration in the expiration, expiration condensate test, and allergological examination.
The diseases which cause stridor and dyspnea such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, insufficiency of left heart, hyperventilation syndrome, etc. become an object of the differentiation.
It is important in the clinical diagnosis that 1) the symptom paroxysmally and repeatedly arises from the air flow restriction, 2) there is at least a part reversibility in the air flow restriction, and 3) other diseases are excluded.
As a result of our genetic analysis, the possibility in which the IL-17F gene fulfils the important role in the disease state of the asthma was guessed.
PAI-1 may be deeply involved in the formation of the remodeling of the airway airway, functional polymorphism of the PAI-1 gene seems to be one of the genetic factors which regulate whether the remodeling of the airway is easy to progress.
CCL5 is the chemokine which is strongly induced from the airway epithelium in viral infection chronic airway inflammation in high-age asthma, and it may fulfil the important role especially for the acquisition of chronic airway inflammation.
When the role of macrophage inhibitory factor was noticed, natural immune system seemed to be deeply concerned in the disease state of the allergy.
From them, the understanding of the disease was deepened, by clarifying the pathophysiological common pathway at the molecular level.
